# Analogous

**Analogous** is a modern applied economics and analytics initiative.  
We develop models, datasets and methods that connect economic theory with real-world decision-making.

## Focus
Our work spans empirical economics, modelling and data science — integrating traditional economic frameworks with modern computational tools.  
Key areas include input–output and cost–benefit analysis, environmental valuation, and consumer behaviour analytics.

## Approach
- **Analytical depth:** Models grounded in rigorous economic reasoning.  
- **Transparency where possible:** Methodologies and frameworks documented for replication and review.  
- **Impact-driven:** Focused on informing better policy, strategy and investment decisions.  

## Selected Streams
- **Economic impact modelling** – IO and CBA frameworks for industry and policy analysis.  
- **Sustainability economics** – modelling decarbonisation, resource efficiency and net-zero transitions.  
- **Consumer data and pricing** – linking product characteristics, marketing and behaviour.  
- **Wellbeing and public value** – quantifying social and non-market outcomes.

## Contribution
